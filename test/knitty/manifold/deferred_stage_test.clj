;; On these tests:
;; CompletionStage has many methods that mimic the chain, zip and alt
;; functions in manifold. Unfortunately, each of these has 3 different versions,
;; one for each java functional interaface, and each version has 3
;; variants/modes, a raw/same thread variant, an async variant which runs in
;; a separate thread when possible, and an async variant that runs
;; in a given executor.
